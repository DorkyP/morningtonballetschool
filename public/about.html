						<p> The Mornington Ballet School is currently in it's 57th year (Est. 1967) and has been providing students of the Mornington Peninsula with high quality tuition using the Cecchetti Method of classical ballet under the watchful eye of Miss Susan Lacco (Director/Principal Teacher).

Miss Sue also holds a Bachelor of Education and is currently a teacher in Specialist Education and working towards her Masters in Autism. As well as classical ballet the school offers classes in Jazz and Tap with teachers specialized in their discipline. The school offers a friendly and child centred program. Each year the school participates in official ballet examinations for students. It also has a two night season of performance which is currently held at the George Jenkins Theatre, Monash University Frankston usually in mid to late November. The school has classes for students as young as two and a half years of age.</p>
						<p>Many young students will ask, "How many sleeps till dancing"? Cecchetti Ballet Australia The "Mornington Ballet School" has always prided itself by teaching the Cecchetti Method of classical ballet. Purity of line and clarity of form as provided by this method of teaching, develops within the student, the sense of self within dance. Students may choose to participate in the examination system but this is not a prerequisite of the school. During this year children have participated in examinations, conventions and scholarships, along with the preparation for the end of year performances. </p>
